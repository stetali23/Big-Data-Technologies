**Hard Disk Drive SMART Data Analysis using Apache Spark**

The enormous growth of data acquisition use cases in recent years has indeed demanded more storage resources, primarily hard disk drives (HDD) where data resides. Based on the organizationâ€™s IT design choices these physical storage components could either be housed at Cloud storage or on-premises datacenters. Data availability from any of these storage implementations heavily depends on reliability characteristics of the underlying infrastructure. Apparently, of all the hardware components, hard disks experience high failure rates and in several cases its quite uncertain to accurately predict failures ahead of the impact, thereby losing service credibility and negatively influences financial prospects.
The scope of this project is primarily based on selected research papers and data collected from Backblaze datasets. In this paper, we will leverage Big Data analytic concepts and characterize data, based on Hard Disks inherent feature called Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART)attributes. Essentially, for the purpose of this study we obtained historical datasets from Backblaze and considered SMART parameters that indicate abnormal hard disk behavior. Data analysis is performed by using Apache Spark implementation and finally established an analytical framework that will help to understand and determine co-relation between parameters (like temperature, capacity, manufacturer etc).
